This page lists **selected** literature and online resources. Some are
related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are
supposed to be of high interest to this site's users.

Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring
[talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KkXEv4r3wWtdKvB6RFOPe809eMNldODaRqQxn-jeME/edit?usp=sharing)
by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.

Overviews
---------

-   Wilson *et al.* (2017): set of **good computing practices** that
    every researcher can adopt
-   British Ecological Society (2014): planning the **data life cycle**;
    creating, processing, documenting, preserving, sharing & reusing
    data
-   Cooper & Hsing (2017): file organisation, workflow documentation,
    **code** reproducibility and readability, writing reproducible
    reports, version control and code archiving
-   Ibanez *et al.* (2014): vision on reproducible science, routine
    **practices**, collaboration, literate computing

See also some resources related to [learning and education](../skills)
and the [discipline of open and reproducible science](../open_science).
