This page lists **selected** literature and online resources. Some are
related to existing tutorial pages, while others are not. They are
supposed to be of high interest to this site's users.

Several of the resources were added based on an inspiring
[talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KkXEv4r3wWtdKvB6RFOPe809eMNldODaRqQxn-jeME/edit?usp=sharing)
by Julia Lowndes at the SAFRED conference, Brussels, 27 Feb 2018.

These resources focus on the learning and teaching aspect, while they
often also give an overview of [scientific computing
workflows](../computing).

Open data science in general
----------------------------

-   Lowndes *et al.* (2017): **learning** open data science tools
-   Hampton *et al.* (2017): **training approaches and needed skills**
    in data science
-   Stevens *et al.* (2018): **local community of practice** for
    scientific programming: why, how (including scheme), challenges

In relation to statistics teaching
----------------------------------

-   Kaplan (2017): ten organizing blocks for **introductory statistics
    teaching** in the present data science context
-   Cetinkaya-Rundel & Rundel (2017): **computational infrastructure and
    toolkit choices** to allow for the necessary pedagogical innovations
    in statistics education
