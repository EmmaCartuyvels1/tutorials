Before each coding club you will usually have to download some data and
some scripts. This can be done manually by going to each of the GitHub
pages but it is much easier to use the `setup_codingclub_session()`
function of the `inborutils` package.

To begin make sure that you have the latest version of `inborutils`
installed by running the following code:

``` r
if (!"remotes" %in% rownames(installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("inbo/inborutils")
```

Next load the library:

``` r
library(inborutils)
```

The function takes four arguments with the following default settings: -
session\_date which is set to the present day - root\_dir which is set
to “.” - src\_rel\_path which is set to “src” - data\_rel\_path which is
set to “data”

``` r
setup_codingclub_session(
  session_date = format(Sys.Date(), "%Y%m%d"),
  root_dir = ".",
  src_rel_path = "src",
  data_rel_path = "data"
)
```

So when we just run the function like this:

``` r
setup_codingclub_session()
```

We will get the coding club materials for the date of today (if and only
if today there is a coding club, otherwise there are no materials) and
these materials will be saved in the `src` and `data` folders of the
current working directory.

If you want to get the coding club materials for a past date, use the
“YYYYMMDD” format, e.g.:

``` r
setup_codingclub_session("20200825")
```

If your folders are not named `src` or `data` (although we would
recommend you name them as such) but for example `scripts` and
`data_codingclub` you can specify this:

``` r
setup_codingclub_session("20200326",
                         src_rel_path = "scripts",
                         data_rel_path = "data_codingclub")
```
