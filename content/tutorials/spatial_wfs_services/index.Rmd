# What is WFS?

In computing, the [Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) **Web Feature Service (WFS)**](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) Interface Standard provides an interface allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls. 
One can think of geographical features as the "source code" behind a map, whereas the Web Mapping Service (WMS) interface or online tiled mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze. 

The standard output format for reading or downloading data from a WFS is the XML-based Geography Markup Language (GML), but other formats like shapefiles or geojson are also available. 
In early 2006 the OGC members approved the OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile. 
This profile is designed both to increase interoperability between WFS servers and to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard. 
(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service))

Before we embark on using a WFS service in R, we would like to draw your attention to the following issue when using a WFS service in a workflow that needs to be reproducible in the longer term. 
A distributed, stable storage of the GIS data used in a workflow is necessary to make that workflow reproducible on a longer term. 
When using dynamic databases and web services, where the data they present are expected to evolve (e.g. by always pointing at the latest release in these WFS-cases), this is not guaranteed if you just use the WFS service to directly read GIS data from it. 
Instead of directly reading the GIS data, it is also possible to download the data from the WFS service to disk (and possibly archive on, e.g., Zenodo) in order to obtain a stable version that can be re-used later by reading it from disk.
Also, in case it takes a long time to get the GIS data from the WFS service, downloading instead of directly reading is often a better choice.
On the other hand, other types of workflows might instead require the most up to date GIS data that are available to be retrieved. 

Some of the material presented in this tutorial benefitted from a tutorial presented at the Use of R in Official Statistics conference in The Hague, September 2018 [Spatial Analysis in R with Open Geodata](https://github.com/TWIAV/Spatial_Analysis_in_R_with_Open_Geodata/) and from @lovelace_geocomputation_2020.

# Useful overviews of web feature services

Some useful overviews of WFS's can be found on the following websites:

- https://gitlab.com/GIS-projects/Belgium-WFS and https://wfs.michelstuyts.be/:  the best overview if you are looking for WFS services for Belgium and regions in Belgium
- [inspire geoportal](https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/): European portal for spatial data - some of which have a WFS service
- [environmental data for Europe](https://discomap.eea.europa.eu/Index/): many of the products listed have either a WMS or a WFS service 
- [spatineo directory](https://directory.spatineo.com/): worldwide monitoring of spatial web services


```{r}
library(sf) # simple features packages for handling vector GIS data
library(httr) # generic webservice package
library(xml2) # package to aid extraction of information from xml files or pages
library(tidyverse) # a suite of packages for data wrangling, transformation, plotting, ...

```

# Read vector data from WFS

This examples illustrates how you can download information from a WFS for further use in R. 

First of all we need the URL of the service. 

```{r}
wfs_bwk <- "https://geoservices.informatievlaanderen.be/overdrachtdiensten/BWK/wfs"
```

## Get to know what the service can do with `GetCapabilities`

```{r}
url <- parse_url(wfs_bwk)
url$query <- list(service = "WFS",
                  version = "2.0.0",
                  request = "GetCapabilities")
request <- build_url(url)
doc <- GET(request) %>% 
  content(as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8") %>% 
  read_xml()
```

With `GetCapabilities`, we obtain a complete overview of all metadata for the web service.

The object `doc` is a pointer to the contents of the [XML page](`r request`). 
To see all capabilities, you can visit this page. 
For instance opening the page in the webbrowser and searching for "Filter_Capabilities" allows you to see all possible ways to filter the data from a WFS layer (e.g. restrict the downloaded data to a specified bounding box with `SpatialOperator name="BBOX"`).

Alternatively, information can also be extracted from the `doc` object with the aid of [XPath language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath). 

The following code extracts available output formats:

```{r}
xpath_output_formats <- paste0(
  "//ows:Operation[@name='GetFeature']",
  "/ows:Parameter[@name='outputFormat']",
  "/ows:AllowedValues/ows:Value")
output_formats <- doc %>% 
  xml_find_all(xpath_output_formats) %>% 
  xml_text()
output_formats
```

The next chunk indicates that the service provides three layers: "BWK:Bwkhab", "BWK:Bwkfauna" and "BWK:Hab3260". 


```{r}
parentKey <- "FeatureTypeList"
childKey <- "FeatureType"
key <- "Name"

xpath_layers <- sprintf(
  "//*[local-name()='%s']/*[local-name()='%s']/*[local-name()='%s']",
  parentKey,childKey,key)
layers <- doc %>%
  xml_find_all(xpath_layers) %>%
  xml_text()
layers
```

Note that the function `sf::st_layers()` does not work for this request.

```{r}
st_layers(request)
```


## Read one of the layers

Let's start by reading in the "BWK:Bwkhab" layer for the Hallerbos area. 

The main part is defining the input and output. 
We store the data in [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) format which is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes. 
It is based on JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation.

We also add the bounding box from which we want to retrieve the data. 
This is very important to add. 
If you omit a bounding box, the service will return the entire map which can be very large.


```{r}
url <- parse_url(wfs_bwk)
url$query <- list(service = "WFS",
                  version = "2.0.0",
                  request = "GetFeature",
                  typename = "BWK:Bwkhab",
                  bbox = "142600,153800,146000,156900",
                  outputFormat = "application/json")
request <- build_url(url)
```

Let's check what we are about to read with `sf::st_layers()`.
This time, the function does return useful information, but the layer name BWK:Bwkhab seems to be overwritten.

```{r}
st_layers(request)
```


```{r}
bwk_hallerbos <- read_sf(request)
```


Note that the `layer = ...` argument of `sf:read_sf()` cannot be used to specify the layer when you pass a WFS GetFeature request to the function.


Let's make a simple plot of the object. 
Note that the object contains features outside of the bounding box. 
Those are features which have only some part within the bounding box.

```{r}
ggplot(bwk_hallerbos) + 
  geom_sf()
```

You can use `sf::st_write()` to save this layer in any of format that is listed by `sf::st_drivers()`.

Here is another example, where  we get the map of provinces of Belgium.

```{r}
wfs_prov <- "http://eservices.minfin.fgov.be/arcgis/services/R2C/Provinces/MapServer/WFSServer"
url <- parse_url(wfs_prov)
url$query <- list(service = "WFS",
                  version = "2.0.0",
                  request = "GetCapabilities")
request <- build_url(url)
doc <- GET(request) %>% 
  content(as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8") %>% 
  read_xml()

```


```{r}
# map of Provinces in Belgium
url <- parse_url(wfs_prov)
url$query <- list(service = "wfs",
                  version = "2.0.0",
                  request = "GetFeature",
                  typename = "provinces",
                  outputFormat = "application/json")
request <- build_url(url)

bel_prov <- read_sf(request) #Lambert2008
```

```{r}
ggplot(bel_prov) +
  geom_sf()
```


## Alternatively, directly download the data

Continuing from the same request we got earlier, we can download the data with `httr::GET` and `httr::write_disk()`.

```{r}
file <- tempfile(fileext = ".geojson")
GET(url = request, 
    write_disk(file))
```

At this point, all features are downloaded and can be used in R as we would we any other local file. 
So we need to load the file with `read_sf()` from `sf`.

```{r}
bwk_hallerbos2 <- read_sf(file)
```


# Download feature attribute data from WFS

In some situations, we do not need the spatial features (polygons, lines, points), but are interested in the data at a particular point (i.e. attribute table data) of the spatial feature. 
When working in a local GIS environment, one would use a spatial operator to extract the data (e.g. `within`, `intersects`, `contains`,...). 
Actually, WFS supports certain spatial operators as part of the service to directly query this data and overcomes the need to download the spatial feature data first.


Consider the following use case: You want to extract the attribute data from a [soil map](http://www.geopunt.be/catalogus/datasetfolder/5c129f2d-4498-4bc3-8860-01cb2d513f8f) for a number of sampling points (point coordinates). 
This use case can be tackled by relying on the WFS service and the affiliated spatial operators.

Our example data point (in Lambert 72):

```{r}
x_lam <- 173995.67
y_lam <- 212093.44
```

From this point we know the data, so we can verify the result (in Dutch):

* Bodemtype:	s-Pgp3(v)
* Bodemserie:	Pgp
* Textuurklasse:	licht zandleem
* Drainageklasse:	uiterst nat, gereduceerd

Hence, we now want to extract these soil properties from the WFS, for the coordinates defined above. 
```{r}
properties_of_interest <- c("Drainageklasse",
                            "Textuurklasse",
                            "Bodemserie",
                            "Bodemtype")
```

The URL of the wfs service of the soil map of the Flemish region:
```{r}
wfs_bodemtypes <- "https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geoserver/bodemkaart/bodemtypes/wfs?"
```

The essential part is to set up the proper query! 
The required data for the service is defined in the [metadata](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geoserver/bodemkaart/bodemtypes/wfs?version=1.1.0&request=GetCapabilities&service=wfs) description. 
This can look a bit overwhelming at the start, but is a matter of looking for some specific elements of the (XML) document:

* `service` (WFS), `request` (GetFeature) and `version` (1.1.0) are mandatory fields (see below)
* `typeName`: Look at the different `<FeatureType...` enlisted and pick the `<Name>` of the one you're interested in. In this particular case `bodemkaart:bodemtypes` is the only one available.
* `outputFormat`: The supported output formats are enlisted in `<ows:Parameter name="outputFormat">`. As the service provides CSV as output, this is a straightforward option. `json` is another popular one.
* `propertyname`: A list of the attribute table fields (cfr. supra). A full list of the Flanders soil map is provided [here](https://www.dov.vlaanderen.be/geoserver/bodemkaart/bodemtypes/wfs?request=DescribeFeatureType).
* We also define the `CRS`, using the [EPSG code](http://spatialreference.org/).
* `CQL_FILTER`: Define the spatial operator, in this case `INTERSECTS` of the WFS `geom` and our `POINT` coordinate. The operators are enlisted in the `<ogc:SpatialOperators>` field.

Formatting all this information in a query and executing the request (`GET`) towards the service:

```{r}
query <- list(service = "WFS",
             request = "GetFeature",
             version = "1.1.0",
             typeName = "bodemkaart:bodemtypes",
             outputFormat = "csv",
             propertyname = as.character(paste(properties_of_interest,
                                               collapse = ",")),
             CRS = "EPSG:31370",
             CQL_FILTER = sprintf("INTERSECTS(geom,POINT(%s %s))",
                                  x_lam, y_lam)) 
result <- GET(wfs_bodemtypes, query = query)
result
```

The result is not yet formatted to be used as a dataframe. 
We need to use a small *trick* using the `textConnection` function to get from the result (bits) towards a readable output in a dataframe:

```{r}
df <- read.csv(textConnection(content(result, 'text')))
knitr::kable(df)
```

Which indeed corresponds to the data of the coordinate.

This procedure can also be turned into a function with lat, long and properties of interest as parameters.
